# Solar Plant Forecaster - Implmentation
Use machine learning to forecast energy production based on weather prognosis and sun angle parameters.

## Input parameters

- Azimuth. Compass direction of the sun.
- Altitude.  Angle height of the sun.
- Temperature. Air temperature  in Celsius.
- Rain. Rain in mm.
- Clouds. Cloud in percent.
- Wind. Wind in m/s.

The sun angles were given by tables based on location, data and time.
The other parameters were downloaded from Swedish meteorological institute, SMHI, from closest weather station about 13 km to the east of the plant.

## Output parameter
Output electrical energy was extracted from en solar converter.

## Training data
The parameters were picked from the f 1st say in the months Mars to October, i.e. 10 days. For each day hourly samples were made from sun rise to sun set.

In total 114 values of training data.

## Test data
The parameters were picked from the 15th day in the months Mars to October, i.e. 10 days. For 08.00, 12:00 and 16:00 o'clock. each day hourly samples were made from sun rise to sun set.

In total 24 values of test data.

## Model
As a model a sequential TensorFlow model was used
- Normalized input layer.
- Second layer of 100 Nodes activated by ReLU.
- Third layer of 80 nodes activated by Linear.
- Output layer of 1 node activated by Linear.

Epoch was set to 2000.

## Result
The loss in fitting the training data was 0.04
The loss of the test data was 14.68

## Summary
The model parameters could certainly be better fitted by further elaboration.

The distance to the weather station, 13 km, gives an uncertainty of local weather, which could be delayed, earlier or inaccurate.

There is strong correlation between sun angles and temperature, i.e. season and time of the day.

Thereâ€™s a rather strong correlation between sun angles and weather parameters in generated electrical energy from a solar plant.
